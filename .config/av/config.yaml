# pullRequest:
#     # If true, always open PRs as a draft.

#     # is specified on commands that create pull requests.
#     draft: false
#
#     # If true, pull requests will be temporarily transitioned to draft state
#     # while being rebased. This avoids accidentally adding unnecessary reviewers
#     # to a pull request due to a CODEOWNERS file while the pull request is in a
#     # transient state. This only applies when a pull request's base branch is
#     # changing.
